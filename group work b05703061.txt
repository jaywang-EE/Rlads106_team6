（1）看到這筆資料，我想到什麼問題
It is difficult to see the positive trend without a proper illustration; as such, potential customers might be discouraged upon observing seemingly small figures without realizing the actual benefits they could have enjoyed. This would be a potential loss to the firm.
（2）這個問題可以用現有資料解決?？
Yes, it is possible.
（3）這個問題需要用什麼方法解決？例如在R裡可以怎麼解決，還是用其他方式？
Since the problem is the lack of a proper illustration to depict the upward trend of the return of investment, the solution would naturally be to provide an appropriate graph or chart to accompany the set of values depicted in the table. While there are various ways to plot data from a table, perhaps the most appropriate type of chart to be used in this scenario would be a line graph with the rate of return on the y axis and time to be on the x axis. This is because the objective is to display the positive growth in trend of the return of investment, a pie chart would be inappropriate as the data set does not represent something from a hundred percent, rendering a pie chart as an ineffective method to convey the message. A histogram, on the other hand, would proof superfluous as it lacks appropriate aesthetics to be on display to the potential customer.  A line graph is therefore the most effective and visually appealing methodology to present idea of an increasing trend since it is simple, yet shows dynamic characteristics. A line graph of this sort can be easily graphed using the plot function in R. Despite the possibility to execute similar actions in other programs such as Microsoft Excel, using R as a method of input is much faster and efficient, which is beneficial for firms with much larger data sets. With that stated, R is thereby the most effective and efficient methodology in providing a clear illustration of the aforementioned idea.
